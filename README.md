## Environment Setup

To get started with this NLP project, we recommend using a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

### 1. Create and activate a Python 3.8 virtual environment

Using conda:
```bash
conda create -n nlp_env python=3.8
conda activate nlp_env
```

### 2.Install required dependencies
Make sure you are in the project root directory (where `requirements.txt` is located), then run:
``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**And You Are All SetÔºÅ**
